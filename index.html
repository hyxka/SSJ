                        to me jeon you are very intersting and understanding person. you listen to everyone's thoughts and every continue to put your inputs into it too which is so cute and amazing, i like that people i dont feel like a fool trying to say something. you also somehow are mostly postive and like so much happy energy? talking to you is a serotonin boost ong. also i love how you sometimes type in Alt caps its so funny pls. one thing i admire about you is the way you always to help people and hope the best for them,,, its so mesmerising. i hope that you keep being this cute and happy little butterfly which goesn from flower to flower. but hey its okay to be sad in awhile,,that is what makes us human afterall :>
